Our user interfaces are often built completely custom or modified from an open-source system. An issue each design and development team has is the lack of a single source of truth of our design and code. With a Design System everyone can contribute to design and code in a scalable manner without hiding in their own teams and building custom user interfaces all the time.

## How React helps

To achieve this single source of truth goal then user interfaces are best distributed at the component level where the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are coupled together. This is where React comes in to aid in the building of user interfaces as components so that they can be versioned, distributed, and maintained.
