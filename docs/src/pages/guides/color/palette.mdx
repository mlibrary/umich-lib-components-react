## Primary

Our primary palette is comprised of our brand colors (maize and blue), gray, and teal. These colors are present across most interfaces. Recommendations for when and how to use these shades can be found in [guidelines](/guides/color/guidelines).

<ColorPalette colors={['maize', 'blue', 'neutral', 'teal']} />

## Secondary

Our secondary palette is made up of orange, pink, indigo, and green. These colors are used sparingly to add visual interest and pops of color. Orange, pink, and green may be used to communicate warning, error, or success messages. For more information, visit [guidelines](/guides/color/guidelines).
