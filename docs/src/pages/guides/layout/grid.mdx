<Text lede>Grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns that hold content. U-M Library’s Design System uses a responsive, fluid grid system that scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases.</Text>

## Basic structure

<img src={grid} alt="" />

## Margins

The 12 column grid has a maximum width of 1280px. Margins vary depending on screen width.

- **Screen width ≥ 768px = 2XL**
- **Screen width < 768px = M**

See code for using the [Margins component](/guides/layout/code/#margins).

## Gutters

The space between columns is called gutters. Gutters vary depending on screen width.

- **Screen width ≥ 768px = 24px gutter** (size L spacing)
- **Screen width < 768px = 12px gutter** (size SM spacing)

## Columns

Designs should be limited to a maximum of 12 columns. Mobile will have 4 columns.

## Example

Let’s walk through an example where the screen width is 1280px.

- Our margins are 5% of the screen width on each side. This results in 64px on the left and 64px on the right.
- Our gutters (11 in total) are fixed, and at this screen width, are 24px each.
- Our columns (12 in total) are responsive and will automatically size to 74px each (remaining 888px divided by 12).
