<Text lede>Anyone should be able to understand how our websites work without instruction. The products and services we create should be accessible for all people, regardless of their mental or physical abilities.</Text>

Every component aims to be compliant with [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) (Level A and AA).

## The four principles of accessibility

The standard guidelines for web content accessibility are organized around four principles:

### 1. Perceivable

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. Among other affordances, this means providing text for those who cannot hear, and audio for those who cannot see.

**Ask yourself:** Is there anything on our website that a blind, deaf, low vision, or color blind user would not be able to perceive?

### 2. Operable

User interface components and navigation must be operable. People with disabilities need to be able to operate websites and applications with a variety of tools. Alternatives like keyboard-based operation should be implemented.

Most importantly, sites and apps should be forgiving. All people, not just those with disabilities, make mistakes. Offer second chances, instructions, cancellation options, and warnings to help all users.

**Ask yourself:** Can all functions of our website be performed with a keyboard? Can users control interactive elements of our website?

### 3. Understandable

If users can perceive and operate a website, that doesn't mean they can understand it. Understandable websites use clear, concise language and offer functionality that is easy to comprehend. If a user takes an action, the connection between the action and the result should be obvious. If this feels like usability and not accessibility, that's because usable websites are inherently more accessible.

**Ask yourself:** Is all of the text on our website clearly written? Are all of the interactions easy to understand?

### 4. Robust

Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. Within limits, websites should work well-enough across platforms, browsers, and devices to account for personal choice and user need.

One of the best ways to meet the principle of robustness is to follow development standards and conventions.

**Ask yourself:** Is our website developed with standards and best practices?
