## Using shadows to create layers

Elements with shadows can help users understand an interface. Shadows indicate hierarchy of elements by differentiating between two objects. In some cases, shadows help users to understand that one object is above another.

## Guidelines
- Use a **z-space 8** as a hover effect for cards.
- Use a **z-space 16** for megamenus or other dropdown menus.
- Don't use shadows for style only.
- Use shadows to make difference in surface elevation perceptible.
