import { Text, Z_SPACE, SPACING } from '@umich-lib/core'

<Text lede>Use layers to create depth in the interface. The distance from one layer to another is measured along the z-axis.</Text>

Both the size and softness of a shadow express the distance between two surfaces. For example, a surface with a shadow that is small and sharp indicates a surfaceâ€™s close proximity to the surface behind it. Larger, softer shadows, express more distance.

```js
import { Z_SPACE } from '@umich-lib/core'
```

```jsx live
<Alert
  intent="error"
  style={{
    display: 'inline-block',
    ...Z_SPACE[16]
  }}
>
  Your list has been deleted.
</Alert>
```

## Available z-spaces

Distance between surfaces is measured in `z-spaces`. Here is a preview of all shadows by **z-space** units.

<ol style={{
  display: 'grid',
  gridTemplateColumns: "repeat(auto-fill, minmax(12rem, 1fr))",
  gridGap: SPACING['L']
}}>
  {Object.keys(Z_SPACE).map(z => (
    <li style={{
      textAlign: 'center',
      padding: SPACING['XL'],
      fontWeight: '600',
      ...Z_SPACE[z]
    }}>{z}</li>
  ))}
</ol>
