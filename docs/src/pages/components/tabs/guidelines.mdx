<Text lede>Tabs are used to quickly navigate between related, yet different information. Tabs allows content to be viewed without having to navigate away from that page.</Text>

## Guidelines
- Like links and buttons, tab labels should be 3 words or less, and no more than 5.
- Do not use icons in tab labels.
- Aim for 5 tabs or less, but no more than 7.
