import { Text } from '@umich-lib/core'

<Text lede>Provides screenreader friendly alert messages. In many apps developers add "alert" messages when network events or other things happen. Users with assistive technologies may not know about the message unless you develop for it.</Text>

The Alert component will announce to assistive technologies whatever you render to the screen. If you don't have a screenreader on you won't notice a difference between rendering `<Alert>` vs. a `<div>`.

## When to use which alert
- Informational alerts should be used when there are tips or general information that a user can benefit from.
- Warning alerts should be used when an action is unusual or undesirable.
- Error alerts should be used when the system has failed to do something or when the user has done something incorrectly.
- Success alerts should be used when an action was performed successfully.

## Guidelines
- Don’t overdo it. Alerts disrupt the user experience and should appear one at a time. Too many alerts may overwhelm or annoy the user.
- Allow users to dismiss alerts whenever appropriate.
- Write short, yet specific alerts. Let users know exactly what’s going right or wrong, rather than writing a general message that can be used in several situations.
- Be polite and take the blame when appropriate. Instead of saying “You’re having connection issues”, try “We’re having trouble connecting”.
- Be clear and conversational. Think about how you might explain a technical error to your non-technical friends.
