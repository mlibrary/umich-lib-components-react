<Text lede>Use Loading component when retrieving data or performing slow computations. It helps to notify users that lcontent is being loaded and will take an indeterminate amount of time.</Text>

## Guidelines
- Do not use more than one spinner per page.
- Place the spinner where you want the usersâ€™ attention to be when loading is finished.
- Only show a spinner if the expected wait time is more than 2 seconds. Avoid using spinners for wait times of over 10 seconds. For longer wait times, you a progress bar may be a better choice.
