<Text lede>Headings provide structure and visual reference points for users. They are used as the titles of each major section of a page and help readers scan content. A clear and consistent heading structure helps screen reader users to navigate the page.</Text>

<Insight kind="research">
  The most important piece of information or action for the user should be in the headings. Users tend to scan a page instead of closely reading paragraph text.
</Insight>

## Guidelines

**Headings should**:
- be written in sentence case
- appear above the section of the interface they refer those
- be informative and descriptive, yet concise and scannable
- avoid using punctuation such as periods, comma, or semicolons
- avoid using ampersands (&) or plus signs (+) unless the official name contains those characters or if space is limited

<Insight kind="accessibility">
  Skipping heading levels can be confusing and should be avoided.
