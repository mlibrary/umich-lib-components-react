## Text field elements
- **Label**: should indicate what kind of information the field requires. The label should be clear, concise, appear directly above the input field, and be left-aligned. 
  - Example: “Date of birth”
- **Placeholder text**: (also known as ghost text) should let people know how to use the field.
  - Example: “Enter as MM/DD/YYYY”
- **Input area**: this is where users enter text.

## Guidelines

- Text fields may include inline validation to alert users whether their input meets the field’s requirements.
- Text fields may have character limits and/or counters. Use the character limit and/or counter to let users know long their entry can be before they begin typing.
- Text input fields should be only slightly longer than the expected input. This provides users with a contextual clue for how long their input should be, but also prevents text from wrapping or being hidden.
