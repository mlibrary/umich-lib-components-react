## Guidelines for the Universal Header

### The Universal Header launcher
- Order of items in the UH launcher is determined by the Web Presence Steering Committee with the primary consideration being library-wide priorities.
- We do not attempt to group items into categories or under headings, as groupings are relative based on audience and would be very difficult to make broadly meaningful.

### Applying the Universal Header to a site
- There may be sites that display the UH, but are not listed in the launcher. This may include tools or pages that arenâ€™t a common landing page or sites specific to staff.

## Inclusion criteria for launcher
- There are a limited number of items that can be shown as primary items in the launcher
- Items will be selected as primary items by the Web Presence Steering Committee based on high use and value to a broad audience, as well as considering core communication channels for outreach and sharing about the work of the library. 
- The  launcher is intended to direct users to top level sites and services, but this criteria is generally flexible.
