## Structure

Cards consist of an image, title, description, and sometimes, details (such as a date, time, or location). The image is typically wider than it is tall, with a ratio of about 1.8:1 that is roughly maintained as screen size changes. The padding remains consistent as screen size changes.

## Best practices

- All content in a card should relate to one single idea.
- The card image is purely decoration and must not be required to understand the Card.
- The entire card should be clickable.
- Limit the amount of content in each card. Cards should be thought of as an entry point to further details, rather than the full details themselves.
- Avoid multiple links within a single card. Since the whole card is clickable, itâ€™s counterintuitive to have other links nested within the card.
- Use high quality images that work well with the (roughly) 1.8:1 aspect ratio.
