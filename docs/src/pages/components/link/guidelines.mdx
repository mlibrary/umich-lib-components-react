import { Text } from '@umich-lib/core'

<Text lede>Links are primarily used as a navigational elements. They may also change what or how data is displayed (i.e. view all). If the action taken by the user will change or manipulate data, use a button.
</Text>

## Guidelines
- Links should include a text label rather than a standalone graphic or icon.
- Links should be three words or less, and never more than five.
- Link labels should be consistent with the intended destination.
- Avoid vague links like “Click here” or “More”. Links should be descriptive and meaningful.
- Links that appear among body text should have an underline in the resting state to clearly indicate that it is a link.
- Links that appear in a group or list do not need an underline in ther esting state, but it should appear on hover.

## To underline or not to underline?

Links that appear among body text should always be underlined. This helps to clearly indicate what is clickable and what is not.

Links that appear in a list or grouping (such as navigation, in the footer, or as side navigation) are more easily perceived as links, and do not need to be underlined in the resting state. They should receive an underline on hover.
