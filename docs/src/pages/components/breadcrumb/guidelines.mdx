Breadcrumbs are an important navigation element that make users aware of their current location in relation to the rest of the website. Breadcrumbs are typically easily understood by users, require little space, and facilitate discovery. However, they are not always necessary. Check out our guidelines below to find out whether your site needs breadcrumbs, and if so, how to best implement them.

## Does my site need breadcrumbs?

**Do** use breadcrumbs if

- the user is most likely to have landed on the page from an external source
- the website is large and has clear heirarchy

**Don't** use breadcrumbs if

- the site is single-level and doesn't have a logical hierarchy

## Guidelines

- Breadcrumbs should appear in the top left corner of the screen, just below the primary navigation and above the page title.
- The breadcrumb trail should display the current page within the site’s hierarchy, not the session history.
- The breadcrumb trail should start with a link to the homepage.
- Include the current page as the last item in the breadcrumb trail, but do not make it a link.
- Use the “navigate_previous” icon to separate links.
- Breadcrumbs should not wrap to multiple lines. On mobile, consider shortening the breadcrumb trail to only include the last level(s).
- Breadcrumbs are a supporting navigational element and should never replace the primary navigation.
