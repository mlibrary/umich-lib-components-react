## Let us know about research insights 
Do you have research that backs up existing styles, components, or patterns and corresponding insights to add to the Design System? Or findings that show we should maybe make some changes? Please let us know! The best way to get in touch about research is sending a message to the #design-system channel on Slack. 

## Suggest changes to an existing style, component, or pattern

Please suggest changes to something that already exists in the Design System by sending a message to the #design-system channel on Slack.

## Propose a style, component, or pattern

### 1. Check the backlog

Check if someone else has already suggested your idea or something similar on the [community backlog](https://github.com/mlibrary/umich-lib-ui/labels/proposal).

If your idea is on the backlog and marked as ‘proposed’, follow the link and comment on the issue. Say you need the component or pattern and share any examples or evidence you have to support the proposal.

### 2. Raise an issue for an review

If your idea is not on the backlog, [raise an issue using the template](https://github.com/mlibrary/umich-lib-ui/issues/new). A member of the Design System team will get in touch to discuss your proposal.

At this stage, **you just need to present your idea and evidence of the user needs**. You can include screenshots or links to versions of the component or pattern in use, but avoid spending time working on a specific design or writing code.

The team reviews proposals to check they meet the following criteria. 

#### Contribution criteria

1. **Useful** - There is evidence that it would be useful for many teams or services. Evidence could be screenshots or links to versions of it being used in different services.

2. **Unique** - It does not replicate something already in the Design System. If it’s intended to replace an existing style, component, or pattern, there is evidence to show that it’s better than the existing version.

If the team finds that your proposal is useful and unique, it will be marked as ‘to do’ on the community backlog. At this point, you can either start to develop the component or pattern or leave it for someone else to work on.

## Develop a style, component, or pattern

Anyone can choose to work on items marked ‘to do’ in the [community backlog](https://github.com/mlibrary/umich-lib-ui/labels/proposal).

If you see something you would like to work on, email the Design System team at [design-discovery@lib.umich.edu](mailto:design-discovery@lib.umich.edu) for help getting started.
