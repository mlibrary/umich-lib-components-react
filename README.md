# [deprecated] University of Michigan Library (React) Design System

> **Note about depreciation**: We've moved our focus to web standards (Web Components, CSS Custom Variables). [Learn more in our design system updates](https://design-system.lib.umich.edu/updates/#july-2020).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mlibrary/umich-lib-ui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mlibrary/umich-lib-ui) [![Maintained with Lerna](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-lerna-cc00ff.svg)](https://lerna.js.org/) [![PRs welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/mlibrary/umich-lib-ui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

A collection of shared design styles, components, and patterns for teams to build quality consistent interfaces. A bit like a LEGO kit.

```
npm install @umich-lib/core
```

## Contributing

### Getting started

This project uses:
- [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) to manage multiple packages/libraries.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for a development environment.
- [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for a fast website.

Run these commands before doing anything else.
```
git clone https://github.com/mlibrary/umich-lib-ui.git
cd umich-lib-ui
npm install
```

### ‚å®Ô∏è Development

Starts the Storybook development environment at `http://localhost:9001` and opens the documentation site at `http://localhost:8000`.

```sh
npm run bootstrap
npm run build:watch
npm run storybook
```

#### What's going on with these commands?

- `npm run bootstrap` tells Lerna to optimize package dependencies and hoists common packages to the root. It will also symlink local packages that depend on each other.
- `npm run build:watch` builds the packages with babel so that they can be consumed by the documentation website and published to NPM.
- `npm run storybook` Starts the Storybook development environment.

### Documentation site

Start the doc site locally. Built with [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for a fast website.

```sh
cd packages/docs
npm run develop
```

Be sure to run commands from the `docs` package directory.

### üì¶ Publishing

‚ùó An NPM account with the [umich-lib-ui organization](https://www.npmjs.com/org/umich-lib-ui) is required to publish. Only core-contributors are able to publish versions. Contact the core team to get help setting this up.

## Export Components to Sketch

We use [story2sketch](https://github.com/chrisvxd/story2sketch) library to handle turning our Storybook stories into _almost_ Sketch. See the story2sketch repo for more info.

Make sure Storybook is active before running this command.

```
npm run sketch
```

This enables designers to use Design System components in Sketch.
